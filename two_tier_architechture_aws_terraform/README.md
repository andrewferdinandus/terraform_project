# 🏗️ Two-Tier AWS Infrastructure using Terraform

This Terraform project provisions a two-tier AWS architecture with a VPC, public/private subnets, an Application Load Balancer (ALB), EC2 application instances, and an RDS MySQL database.
The design follows best practices for network segmentation, scalability, and security.
